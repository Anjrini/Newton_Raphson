## Newton Raphson

The script is an implementation of the Newton Raphson method using R.

## Libraries:

```
no library needed. We are lying on R Base.
```

## The Funtion

the function is located in the file named "newton_raphson.R" and defined as follows:
```
newton_raphson<- function(x)
```
where:
- x: the initial value of x. It can also be a vector of intial values for functions having more than one root.

## Running the Script

```
line 8:  the function to be considered. Please change it accordingly
line 12: the derivative of the function to be considered. Please change it accordingly
line 24: the initial value / values
line 27: running the implemented function newton_raphson(x)
```

## Exmaple

 I have provided an example of the following function: $$x^{3}+4x^{2}-x-4$$ and using its derivative as follows: $$3x^{2}+8x-1$$

 The results after running the script are: $$1, -1, -4 $$
